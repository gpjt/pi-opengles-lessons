# pi-opengles-lessons

This is a work-in-progress port of my old WebGL lessons at 
https://github.com/gpjt/webgl-lessons over to Python 3.6, 
for OpenGL ES 2.0 on the Raspberry Pi. 

Thanks to:

* The base code I started from by Peter de Rivaz: https://github.com/peterderivaz/pyopengles
* Helpful hints from this forum thread: https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/197893-View-and-Perspective-matrices
